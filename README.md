# Seoul-Bike-Sharing-EDA-with-Python
## Intro:
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. As an active user of Seoul City's bike sharing system, I decided to conduct an exploratory data analysis of the Seoul Bike Dataset from 2017. Particular area analyzed in the dataset were districts by bike borrowing activity as well as types of bike stations that were popular e.g bike stations near train stations, universities and schools etc. Also, due to the availability of the date feature, I was able to explore the seasonal trend of bike sharing in 2017 as well as a week's trend in bike sharing.
